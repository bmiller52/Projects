Simple script I wrote to resize and compress mass amounts of pictures using Python Imaging Library

To use: 
1)  Install the module PIL. Otherwise this wonâ€™t work
2)  put pictures in the folder marked "Uncropped"
3)  Run image_resizer.py
4)  Compressed and resized images are moved to Cropped_and_moved

To change sizing/compressing, change the following variables in image_resizer:
intended_width and picture_quality
